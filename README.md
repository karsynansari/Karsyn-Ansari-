## Me in 4 Lines of Markdown 

🖤 I love problem-solving, challenging myself, and using my skills for good, which is why I decided to learn to program!


🌱 I believe we can always do better by our fellow humans and our planet, and I don't believe in settling for anything less 


🎓 I graduated from Flatiron School's Live Software Engineering Program in April 2022


🤗 I'm excited to dive more into data structures & code some fun projects this summer
